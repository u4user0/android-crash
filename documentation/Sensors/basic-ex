Most android powered devices have built-in sensors that measures orientation, motion, and various environmental conditions. We can get gestures and motion such as tilt, shake, rotation etc.

Categories of sensors:

(i) motion sensors 

(ii) environmental sensors 

(iii) positional sensors 

Motion sensors:

These sensors measures acceleration forces & rotational forces along three axes.

This category includes-

Accelerometer, gravity sensor, gyroscope & rotational vector sensors. 

Environmental sensors: 

These sensors measures various environmental parameters such as ambient air temperature & presure, illumination & humidity 

This category includes-

Barometers, thermometers & photometers.

Positional sensors: 

these sensors measures the physical position of a device.

This category includes- 

Orientation sensors & magnetometers.
